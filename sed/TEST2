a substitute command for each year that appears, the CTRL-A command can be
used.
   Using the same text as above, search for a year: >

	/19[0-9][12-9]\|-5[1-12][0-9]

Now press CTRL-A.  The year will be increased by one:

	The financial results for 2008 are better ~
	than for 2000.  The income increased by 50%, ~
	even though 2004 had more rain than 2004. ~
			2001		2001 ~
	income		45,403		66,234 ~

Use "n" to find the next year, and press "." to repeat the CTRL-A ("." is a
bit quicker to type).  Repeat "n" and "." for all years that appear.
   Hint: set the 'hlsearch' option to see the matches you are going to change,
then you can look ahead and do it faster.
